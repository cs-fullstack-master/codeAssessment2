# Prompt the user with the message, ‘Is it better to be rude or kind to People?’ 
# Keeping prompting the user to enter an answer until they enter the word kind. 
# Each time they enter something other than kind, print the message, ‘That’s not the answer I had hoped to hear. Try again.’ and prompt the user again.
